# üìú Repository Rules and Best Practices

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ General Repository Structure
- Maintain a **clear folder structure** (e.g., `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `configs/`).
- Use `.github/` for automation settings (issue templates, workflows, PR rules).
- Keep `main` branch stable and production-ready.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Branching Rules
- Follow a structured **branching strategy**:
  - `main`: Production-ready, no direct commits.
  - `dev`: Active development, merges into `main` after testing.
  - `feature/feature-name`: New features, merged into `dev`.
  - `fix/issue-name`: Bug fixes, merged into `dev`.
  - `hotfix/critical-issue`: Emergency fixes, merged into `main`.
- Protect `main` with branch rules (require reviews before merging).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow **conventional commit messages**:
  - `feat: add new user authentication`
  - `fix: resolve crash when loading page`
  - `docs: update README with installation steps`
- PRs should be **small, focused, and linked to issues**.
- Require at least **one review before merging**.
- No direct commits to `main`.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Management
- Use **GitHub Issues** for tracking bugs and feature requests.
- Apply appropriate labels:
  - `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `good first issue`
  - `severity: high`, `urgency: immediate`
- Assign issues and milestones to maintain workflow.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Code Quality & Automation
- Enforce code formatting using **linters and formatters** (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Black).
- Implement **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions) to run tests before merging PRs. (Optional)
- Write **unit tests** for core functionality. (Optional)

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation & Communication
- Keep **README.md** updated with setup instructions and project goals.
- Maintain a **CONTRIBUTING.md** guide for new contributors.
- Use **CHANGELOG.md** to track major updates and releases.

## üî• Following these rules will keep the repository structured, scalable, and maintainable! üöÄ
